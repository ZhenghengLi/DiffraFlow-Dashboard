    <p>
        DiffraFlow (<strong>Diffra</strong>ction Image Data <strong>Flow</strong>) is a distributed software developed
        for the extremely high throughput data acquisition and online analysis of pixel array detectors that are
        typically used with the X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) facility. This software is designed to have good
        horizontal scaling capability that can run on tens of computer nodes to handle the data stream of up to 100
        GiB/s from pixel array detectors. There are several different components in this software, they are
        <i>dispatcher</i>, <i>combiner</i>, <i>ingester</i>, <i>monitor</i>, <i>controller</i> and <i>aggregator</i>.
        And they are responsible for different tasks including data receving, online event-building, calibration, deep
        event filtering, data saving, quasi-realtime analysis for fast feedback, runtime parameters adjustment and
        system working status monitoring.

        This dashbord serves as a GUI of the DiffraFlow project, which can dynamically display the current working
        status of the whole system (in METRICS page), dynamically monitor the current image and related analysis results
        and configure the runtime parameters of <i>ingester</i> and <i>monitor</i> (in PANEL page). The data flow within
        DiffraFlow project for this dashboard is shown below.
